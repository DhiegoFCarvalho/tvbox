This is a manual explaining how to install restored firmwares in a TVBox using multitool software.
TX9 (RK3228A) model firmware has 23.02 armbian and 6.1.11 Linux kernel versions, available in:
1. Graphical Interface - (comGUI)
2. Without Graphical Interface - (semGUI)

Both have the same users and passwords:
1. User login: icts
2. User password: icts12345
3. root password: icts12345

**WARNING**: Due to outdated WiFi and Bluetooth drivers, they are highly unstable and unreliable. When you reboot the TV box, there is a high probability that the WiFi and Bluetooth interfaces will disappear from your screen. 
But ok, it is not the End of the World, you can also plug a Wifi Dongle in USB connector
